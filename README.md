# Wolf 3D

## Project Description
Wolf 3D is a 2.5D game inspired by Wolfenstein 3D (as the name implies).
This project is being worked on as part of my studies at EPITECH.

## Compile Instructions
To compile the standard version of wolf3D,
simply run make:

```bash
make
```

To compile a version with debug symbols enabled,
use the ``debug`` rule:

```bash
make debug
```

The address sanitize can be run using the ``sanitize`` rule.

```bash
make sanitize
```
_Note: This should only be used for testing purposes._

When you're done, you can use the ``clean`` rule
to delete any temporary files, or the ``fclean``
rule to delete everything but the source code.
